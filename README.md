Accurately tracking the amount of energy expended or the number of calories burned during physical activities is essential for individuals aiming to monitor their health, fitness, and weight management goals. Traditional methods, such as fitness trackers, often rely on generalized formulas that may not account for individual variability in age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, duration, body temperature, and exercise intensity, leading to inaccurate estimations. With an increasing demand for personalized health insights, developing a model that considers these individual differences is essential to provide accurate calorie expenditure measurements.

This project aims to create a Machine Learning Model that predicts calorie expenditure based on various personal and physiological factors. A dataset sourced from Kaggle is used, which includes diverse demographic and physical activity data, points to ensure generalizability across different users. Using this, we explored and compared different regression techniques, evaluating their performance. We also emphasized the error rates based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. The final deliverable identifies the best-performing model with the highest accuracy and minimal error rate, offering a more precise method of calorie estimation tailored to each individualâ€™s unique characteristics.
